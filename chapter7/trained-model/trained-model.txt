Please use the following Trained models for different platforms. These models are trained by AWS on and available for 1-click deploy.

1. Choose the appropriate ModelResourceKey for your platform :

    armv7l: "DLR-resnet50-armv7l-cpu-ImageClassification"
    x86_64: "DLR-resnet50-x86_64-cpu-ImageClassification"
    aarch64: "DLR-resnet50-aarch64-cpu-ImageClassification"

2. Update the following attributes in the model-manifest.json for your respective platform :

armv7l - 

"Uri": "greengrass:uWN5K8yylhf40Qkd4IQQVubNNP5DUxXWqJ1UdMLSlFc=/DLR-resnet50-armv7l-cpu-ImageClassification.zip",
"Digest": "eXhRRprcv2IU6/WmLuUKPfflpwGfHo4fhNDIr6mVqy4=",

x86_64 (or amd64) -

"Uri": "greengrass:zJ5Dr5g2v7Uw6W_EH8_Le1HqyZEfDXLKRZwNMqB1PL0=/DLR-resnet50-x86_64-cpu-ImageClassification.zip",
"Digest": "fqOAFmRZmQedxdvsommEvXN2Dw1856Q42Wz5hStcVMw=",

aarch64 (or arm64) -

"Uri": "greengrass:lpLfSdom6sLbtzMD_Hkn6ezGoMYOsfi9YcfSaEDk2pA=/DLR-resnet50-aarch64-cpu-ImageClassification.zip",
"Digest": "onGJklvuguVotGEf/eE+4y1vx/JLTTkqDbEyyiBQ0Ik=",
